# Portfolio optimization
## Project Summary
- Implemented **Markowitz mean-variance optimization** to generate **efficient frontier** of multiple tickers
- Plot of randomly-distributed weights with corresponding **Sharpe ratios**
- Determined **equal allocation**, **minimum risk**, and **tangency** portfolios and the corresponding **capital market line**
- Backtested tangency portfolio using the **dual moving average crossover strategy** (short-term period of 50 days, long-term period of 100 days) to generate buy/sell signals
- Output total return, volatility max drawdown, and outperformance in comparison to S&P 500
